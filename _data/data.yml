  title: "Climate Policies under Dynamic Factor Adjustment"
  summary: "This paper studies how environmental policies affect global carbon emissions and output when labor and capital adjust dynamically and imperfectly across sectors in response to these policies. I develop a dynamic general equilibrium model of the global economy where the dynamic flows of labor and capital across sectors, including those producing fossil and renewable energy sources, impact emissions and output. I derive a theory-consistent relationship between sector-level supplies of labor and capital and inter-sectoral factor price differences, which can be mapped to the data. Using longitudinal datasets from multiple countries, I estimate the short-run inter-sectoral labor and capital supply elasticities and find that both labor and capital are not highly responsive to changes in inter-sectoral factor price differences. Using a calibrated model, I evaluate how imperfect labor and capital adjustments influence the impact of a unilateral carbon tax on global emissions. When labor and capital adjust imperfectly over time, China's removal of fossil fuel subsidies becomes at least 60 percent less effective in reducing global carbon emissions."

  - title: "Understanding Trade Imbalances"
    summary: "This paper evaluates the drivers of persistent trade imbalances in eight advanced and emerging economies from 2000 to 2014. Using a dynamic general equilibrium framework, this paper rationalizes the observed trade imbalances as resulting from six forces commonly discussed in the literature: (i) productivity growth, (ii) trade costs, (iii) financial frictions, (iv) life expectancy, (v) population growth, and (vi) economy-specific intertemporal distortions. I find that economy-specific intertemporal distortions, particularly those associated with the United States, remain the most significant driver of global imbalances. Additionally, changes in trade costs between China and its trading partners— the China shock— substantially influenced the trade imbalances of both China and the United States. The findings suggest that, in the absence of the China shock, the United States would have maintained persistent trade surpluses, while China would have experienced persistent trade deficits, underscoring the importance of incorporating bilateral trade frictions in understanding global trade imbalances."

    summary: "Amid escalating tensions between the US and China, coupled with the conflict in Ukraine, concerns over the trade fragmentation of commodities intensified. This paper presents a novel framework to evaluate the potential welfare losses resulting from such fragmentation, with a focus on the unique characteristics of commodities, including their high geographical concentration, upstream nature, and limited substitutability.  Using a quantitative general equilibrium model incorporating international trade, firm heterogeneity, variable markups, inter-sectoral linkages, and unique commodity characteristics, we assess the welfare implications of hypothetical persistent disruptions in commodity trade between hypothetical US and China blocs. The model delivers five distinct welfare costs arising from commodity trade fragmentation: (i) declining foreign demand, (ii) increased imported input costs, (iii) competition-driven productivity reduction, (iv) a decline in the number of upstream suppliers, and (v) the increased market power of regional suppliers. We find that the reduction in upstream suppliers and the concurrent rise in regional market power significantly amplify the welfare costs associated with commodity trade fragmentation."
