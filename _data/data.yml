  title: "Climate Policies under Dynamic Factor Adjustment"
  summary: "This paper develops and estimates a dynamic general equilibrium model of the global economy to investigate how imperfect and gradual adjustments of capital and labor across sectors affect the effectiveness of climate policies in reducing global emissions. The model's estimates indicate that  (i) both capital assets and workers exhibit low responsiveness to changes in climate policies, limiting the policies' ability to permanently and swiftly shift capital and labor out of the fossil fuel sector; (ii) capital allocation across sectors exhibits strong persistence over time; and (iii) labor reallocation in response to changes in climate policies is slow, taking 8 years to reach 99 percent completion. I demonstrate that Chinaâ€™s subsidy on non-fossil fuel energy sources boosts domestic consumption and investment but may inadvertently increase global emissions due to rising aggregate investment and output. Imperfect factor mobility amplifies this effect by limiting the reallocation of capital and labor away from the fossil fuel sector. My findings underscore the need to (i) combine a subsidy on non-fossil fuel energy sources with a carbon tax and (ii) improve capital and labor mobility to both reduce global emissions and enhance aggregate consumption."

  - title: "Understanding Trade Imbalances"
    summary: "Are persistent trade imbalances signs of distortions? This paper investigates the drivers of persistent trade imbalances in eight advanced and emerging economies from 2000 to 2014. Using a dynamic general equilibrium framework, I rationalize the observed imbalances as outcomes of six key forces commonly discussed in the literature: (i) productivity growth, (ii) trade costs, (iii) financial frictions, (iv) life expectancy, (v) population growth, and (vi) economy-specific intertemporal distortions. The findings highlight that economy-specific intertemporal distortions, particularly in the United States, are the most significant driver of global imbalances. Additionally, changes in trade costs between China and its trading partners---the China shock---had a substantial impact on the trade imbalances of both China and the U.S. The results suggest that, without the China shock, the U.S. would have sustained persistent trade surpluses, while China would have experienced persistent deficits, emphasizing the importance of bilateral trade frictions in understanding global imbalances."

    summary: "Amid escalating tensions between the US and China, coupled with the conflict in Ukraine, concerns over the trade fragmentation of commodities intensified. This paper presents a novel framework to evaluate the potential welfare losses resulting from such fragmentation, with a focus on the unique characteristics of commodities, including their high geographical concentration, upstream nature, and limited substitutability.  Using a quantitative general equilibrium model incorporating international trade, firm heterogeneity, variable markups, inter-sectoral linkages, and unique commodity characteristics, we assess the welfare implications of hypothetical persistent disruptions in commodity trade between hypothetical US and China blocs. The model delivers five distinct welfare costs arising from commodity trade fragmentation: (i) declining foreign demand, (ii) increased imported input costs, (iii) competition-driven productivity reduction, (iv) a decline in the number of upstream suppliers, and (v) the increased market power of regional suppliers. We find that the reduction in upstream suppliers and the concurrent rise in regional market power significantly amplify the welfare costs associated with commodity trade fragmentation."
