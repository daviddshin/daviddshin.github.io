about_me:
  content: "I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.<br><br> My research focuses on International Economics, Macroeconomics, and Environmental Economics. In my research, I study how capital and labor adjust dynamically in response to climate policies and how these adjustments shape global economic and environmental outcomes. I also examine the causes of persistent trade imbalances, the effects of commodity trade fragmentation, and the welfare implications of economic frictions and policy interventions.<br><br> You can find my <a href='/assets/files/cv.pdf'>CV</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KiTGZocAAAAJ'>Google Scholar</a> profile. <br><br> Feel free to reach me at: dshin5 (at) utk (dot) edu."

  - title: "Climate Policies under Dynamic Factor Adjustment"
    date: "November 2024"
    summary: "This paper develops and estimates a dynamic general equilibrium model of the global economy to investigate how imperfect and gradual adjustments of capital and labor across sectors affect the effectiveness of climate policies in reducing global emissions. The model's estimates indicate that both capital assets and workers exhibit low responsiveness to changes in climate policies, limiting the policies' ability to permanently and swiftly shift capital and labor out of the sector that extracts and processes raw fossil fuels. I demonstrate that a counterfactual subsidy implemented by China on non-fossil fuel energy sources would boost consumption and investment in the targeted sector but may inadvertently raise global emissions due to increased aggregate output and investment. Imperfect factor mobility amplifies this effect by limiting the reallocation of capital and labor away from the sector that produces fossil fuels. My findings underscore the need to (i) combine a subsidy on non-fossil fuel energy sources with a carbon tax and (ii) improve capital and labor mobility to both reduce global emissions and enhance aggregate consumption."

  - title: "Decomposing Persistent Trade Imbalances"
    date: "January 2026"
    summary: "This paper develops a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model to study the drivers of persistent trade imbalances across major advanced and emerging economies from 2000 to 2014. The decomposition analysis shows that persistent trade imbalances reflect different domestic forces across countries: weaker bequest motives in the United States and Mexico, higher public spending in the United Kingdom, and faster productivity growth together with life-cycle investment needs in India. Persistent surpluses in China, Germany, and the Republic of Korea are driven by stronger bequest motives, longer life expectancy, and life-cycle income and investment profiles that support higher saving. A counterfactual analysis shows that China’s accession to the World Trade Organization increased China's trade balance by 0.552 percentage points of GDP on average and lowered the U.S. trade balance by 0.054 percentage points."

    summary: "Commodity markets are highly geographically concentrated and upstream in production networks, raising concerns that geopolitical tensions fragmenting commodity trade may substantially increase market power and amplify economic losses. We develop a multi-country, multi-sector quantitative general equilibrium model featuring international trade, input-output linkages, and endogenous markups to assess welfare losses driven by endogenous market power. Quantitatively, we show that economies directly exposed to commodity trade fragmentation suffer welfare losses, while neutral economies gain by absorbing redirected trade; nevertheless, global welfare declines under both constant- and variable-markup models. We further find that markups in the non-commodity sector respond endogenously to fragmentation, as access to commodity inputs shapes competitiveness and, in turn, markups in downstream industries. Overall, the results highlight the interaction between market power and input-output linkages as an important amplification channel in commodity trade fragmentation."
