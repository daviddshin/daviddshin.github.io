      As an educator in international trade, macroeconomics, and environmental economics, my primary goal is to encourage students to become active learners who are intellectually curious about real-world problems. I strive to equip students from diverse backgrounds with tools to approach these problems using logical reasoning, empirical evidence, and sound methodology. My experience as a TA at Duke University and my participation in the Certificate in College Teaching program have been instrumental in shaping my teaching practices.
